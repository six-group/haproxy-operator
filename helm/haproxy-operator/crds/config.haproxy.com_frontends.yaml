                                    Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded
                                    using the previously defined environment variables in the container and
                                    any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                    the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                    "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                    Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                    exists or not.
